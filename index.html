    <h1>Abiel A. Zamora</h1>
    <h3>Junior Software Engineer</h3>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Since a child, I knew computer science was my path forward in education. The dreams of becoming a game developer faded with age, and when new interests in cyber-security, software engineering, and web-design arose, I knew I had made the correct choice. I began my pursuit of computer science during my senior year of high school by partaking in dual enrollment courses, which allowed me to start my college studies early at our local community college. Being part of the class of 2020 meant that the start of the COVID-19 pandemic would disrupt my studies, ultimately resulting in my transfer to Southern New Hampshire University, where I completed my associate's and bachelor's degrees.</p>
